I suggest looking into it but usually people break fast with bone broth and then slowly incorporate foods that are easier to digest.<br>you are much better off doing an extended fast with atleast sodium and potassium.

Conversely, PUFAs caused a nearly threefold larger increase in lean tissue than SFAs. Increase in liver fat directly correlated with changes in plasma SFAs and inversely with PUFAs. Genes involved in regulating energy dissipation, insulin resistance, body composition, and fat-cell differentiation in SAT were differentially regulated between diets, and associated with increased PUFAs in SAT. In conclusion, overeating SFAs promotes hepatic and visceral fat storage, whereas excess energy from PUFAs may instead promote lean tissue in healthy humans.</span><br><br>I guess is peat said it and his following believes it, it must be true.",

What actually happened:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Participants were simultaneously enrolled and randomized using a computer-generated number (stratified by clinic center, age, sex, and body mass index) by data manager to one of the three isocaloric diets (1:1:1): a lower fat, higher carbohydrate diet (fat 20%, carbohydrate 66% energy); a moderate fat, moderate carbohydrate diet (fat 30%, carbohydrate 56% energy); a higher fat, lower carbohydrate diet (fat 40%, carbohydrate 46% energy).</span><br><br>So a low fat diet produced less fat tissue increases than a higher fat diet. Welcome to nutritional science established in the early 20th century and why despite resistance from all manner of retards, charlatans and opportunists, the expert consensus has very consistently been that we should have low fat diets. This means eating less fat from any source not replacing your sunflower oil with huge heapins of ghee and tallow you morons.",

With milk you might need to fix your gut before you can drink it. Danny Roddy talks about needing antibiotics after carnivore diet fucked him. I&#039;ve always been fine with milk though so lucky me. Orange juice you need to get sweet stuff. I also filter out the pulp and neutralize it with baking soda. Carrot salad is great, I feel the difference when I skip a few days. I think it&#039;s worth making it properly too by peeling into strips, rinsing and squeezing the beta carotene out, and putting salt, coconut and olive oil, and white vinegar.<br><br>I really think going full autism mode pays off with ray peat stuff. That&#039;s another way it&#039;s like Monero, it&#039;s not easy to just do it straight away without learning as you go.<br><br>Gotchas that people don&#039;t usually mention like refined coconut oil, not extra virgin make a big difference. And I think you get heaps of protein with peating. It&#039;s practically GOMAD with extra liver, oysters, cheese, and eggs. I hardly think you need a dozen eggs after that but I think Peat himself is happy to eat two eggs a day and much more when he knows they&#039;re really free range when he&#039;s in rural Mexico.

Eat right (get your protein in | ~1g per pound of body weight) and put your sole focus on your training. Try to keep off the booze and cut out smoking. You say you&#039;ve been training for 4 years but the pictures don&#039;t reflect that. Hit the gym 5-6 days a week, train smart (prioritize compound lifts, train push pull legs, and if you&#039;re lifting for more than an hour and a half/an hour 15 you&#039;re taking too much rest /too much volume), focus on the pump. If you really focus in on good, quality training. You&#039;ll make hella gains but the -CONSITANT- training has to come first.",

The wrist roller is my favorite, high volume with heavy weight (30 to 40lb, the ones you find in the store usually say you can do 40 max so I don&#039;t push it) will do the trick but it&#039;s a grind to get there. I roll forwards (the &quot;hard&quot; way) first then backwards and I count that as one rep. I also do reverse curls with a towel around the bar and pullups with a towel around the bar. Things like grip trainers and a bucket full of rice work too but I find that they bore me so I never stick with either.",

The bar is about the same diameter as a blue fat grip.<br>I bought the latter because the foam handle sectiony one has narrower grips and the foam was slipping.<br>(could probably fix this by taking the foam off and wrapping a lot of duct tape on it or some shit)<br>I dunno if I like the bar one better, though. See the way it is it seems like you&#039;re always putting the weight to one side of the bar so it&#039;s uneven. The foam grip one never really felt like that.<br><br>Jeff has a good forearms vid.

Newfound confidence. Start working out. Quit smoking. Actually starting to get pretty ripped after a year. At the gym on Tuesday and I see a tiny Asian I’ve never seen before with quite the ass. I can’t help but stare. She notices. I make sure to make solid eye contact until she looks away. This is a boss power move and bitches know it. I start leg pressing 350 lbs like a boss. My max before that was 300. Feeling like the man. Go over to the squat rack and start my squat routine. Little Asian girl approaches me. Pulls down her mask to reveal her cute face and perfect teeth. Asks if I’m done with the leg press machine after I clearly haven’t been over their for ten minutes. I smile at her and reply yeah it’s all yours. Two minutes later the biggest guy in the gym comes over and starts flirting with her. Pulls out his phone and gets her number.",

The dopamine mechanism that makes people into addicts is the primary response at play when jacking off (especially with porn). Yes, there are other hormonal factors at play, but the dopamine response is the biggest concern because there is no other feedback mechanism in place when you do fap. You sleep with a woman, there is oxytocin release and the prosocial component that contributes to better mental state and self-esteem. <br>That&#039;s the broad strokes arguments, anyway because this shit is not exactly cut and dry. Im sure if you had enough time, money and resources, you could come up with some personalized process that let&#039;s you fap, then cuddle with a beloved pet then go do team sports to hit that dopamine, oxytocin, prosocial feedback process together, but that seems like a lot compared to just cooming inside an escort or something",

If they want testosterone, they just have to say they are trans and they get roided out without question, but never would a doctor consider giving a man steroids unless he jumps through dozens of hoops to get them. You have to have low testosterone for multiple blood tests, you have to have a serious impact on your lifestyle, you have to have your heart studied, you have to let your doctor finger your asshole and squeeze your prostate. It&#039;s fucking retarded. Men should be able to get roids if they want to, without having to conform to any quack requirements.",

You need to find the calorie range where you&#039;re comfortably and consistently gaining weight, which is probably closer to 3k. Your weight will fluctuate day by day so you&#039;ll want to not sweat the daily changes and focus more on the weekly uptick or downtick. Drinking more water likely has nothing to do with your weight gain or loss.<br><br>On the flip side, those irregular shits aren&#039;t good. I can&#039;t really speak on how it may be hurting your bulk, but just for your digestive system that&#039;s not ideal. You should be shitting at least once a day.",

She admitted to having bad diarrhea. I say “aw” and hug her. I go to bathroom, and I sit down, and immediately noticed there was poo on the toilet paper. I gasped. We are extremely close, tell each other absolutely everything, we’re not scared of offending the other/hurting each other’s feelings when it comes to more crude things. But I knew telling her about this would cross a line. I feel like this exact situation may be the only specific thing in the world I couldn’t tell her.<br><br>I keep thinking about it, and I’m really confused (about how it happened and why?), and I hate to say it but grossed out and a bit concerned? She got poo on her hand while wiping.. okay.. fine, sure. But how did poo get on the surface of the square of toilet paper? What were the logistics there? How much poo was there? And you may find this hard to believe, but this is actually the SECOND time in my life I’ve seen poo on a toilet paper roll. The other time I went into bathroom at a party after a guy who was obviously shitting. As I peed I sat there grossed out knowing he was just here.. pooing. And I saw the roll sitting on the counter, and near the cardboard tube part, there was poo. I was horrified, and ever since then I’ve made a point to check out a roll, and pull a few layers off before wiping. So understand my horror when I’m face to face with poo on a roll, again, from my girlfriend. I’m pretty easily grossed out, and babyishly so. So I’m sort of worried that I’m not going to get over it and it will eat me up inside. And I KNOW I need to grow up and get over it. But I guess I’m just looking for support, or for someone to yell at me so I feel embarrassed about caring this much and just move on with my life.",

Lucky to be employed still (even if getting minimal hours during lockdown) when compared to the millions unemployed where I am and getting kicked off a liveable welfare payment, but the feeling of having your prospects reduced and living hand to mouth is still pretty shit. Government doesn&#039;t care if two million of us fall into poverty because of all this and only want to play power politics. Haven&#039;t seen many of my friends in a meaningful way for almost a whole year now due to COVID. All in all, I&#039;m pretty lucky but I still feel pretty down in the dumps.

I&#039;m in Melbourne (Victoria) though and we had by far the worst outbreak in the country back in June/July, so we went straight from one lockdown to the next basically. Only allowed out of the house for basic necessities, no one allowed over at your home etc. I work in a field that requires me to be out in the community, so my hours have been shafted.

We&#039;ve gotten very little aid and support from them and with 2m+ unemployed of a workforce of about 16m we now have a massive group of people who are getting very desperate to survive after their payments got cut.

He&#039;s 95, he&#039;s had a good life, realistically I knew this day was coming, but it&#039;s still sad. I live in another city, my parents told me not to worry about coming home for a day or two.<br>I was supposed to go on a trip with my gf this weekend to celebrate her birthday. I told her what was happening and she immediately canceled the trip and that I should go be with my family. I was relieved she was being understanding and supportive. But as the day went on, her attitude changed. Long story short, she really wasn&#039;t ok with canceling her birthday trip. I did say &quot;sorry that your trip got canceled, I wish we could make it work, but I can&#039;t go, I need to be with my family.&quot;<br>She told me that she&#039;s &quot;depressed&quot; about it and has been crying all day, and somehow I&#039;m the bad guy because I didn&#039;t apologize more profusely to her and promise to make it up to her. Bitch, I&#039;m a little preoccupied with the imminent death of a family member. I&#039;m sorry my grandpa is dying at an inconvenient time for you.",

Been eating clean and exercising for a little over a week now, but I can&#039;t stop thinking about how it feels like it&#039;s too late and that my highschool/college years sucked because I was fat and unsociable. I&#039;m almost 24 and I feel like you only have till 30 until &quot;the best&quot; years of your life are over. It&#039;s like I&#039;ve wasted so many years, and I don&#039;t know how to cope. It&#039;s gonna be like 2 years before I&#039;m /fit/ and part of me wonders what&#039;s the fucking point of sitting around hungry and bored. At least I had comfort food and liquor when I was a fat slob with a poor diet. I also tell myself that even if I lose most of the weight, I&#039;ll just put it back on (this has happened to me 5 or 6 times now since I was 16. Where I would go from 250 to 200, and then fail to lose the last 20 or 30 pounds and gain it all back. In the most recent bout, I went all the way up to 280, and am now down to 268) I know this is really shitty thinking, and my future self will thank me profusely if I stick with it, but it&#039;s so hard to keep positive thoughts when I have so many past instances of failure.",

I would actually recommend looking at some competition footage to see what it&#039;s really like in practice, it&#039;s not actually like the other guy is saying and is very far from a performance art (and &quot;sloppy kickboxing&quot; is just a way to dismiss it, kickboxing is kickboxing, what makes it sloppy exactly? the skill of the fighters?)<br><br>but it&#039;s really nothing special, it doesn&#039;t really do anything unique and there&#039;s no reason why you should be trying to train it in particular, hell if you don&#039;t live in indonesia I doubt you could even train it if you wanted to. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is wrestling plus win chun good combo or should I do wrestling plus systema?</span><br>you should do wrestling and another real martial art, what are these choices?",

I&#039;m also getting on in years so some tournament wins would be nice, just some trophies really even if its for my vanity, I never bothered competing.

But the anus will recover enough to seal in less than half an hour. For anything fist-sized or smaller that you&#039;ve been playing with for less than an hour, it&#039;ll recover in less than a minute. By two or three hours after you&#039;ve finished you won&#039;t even be able to tell you ever had anything up there.<br><br>Wearing girthy buttplugs for long periods (2 hours plus) for a long time will fuck up your ass, though. Probably. It&#039;s not well-studied.<br><br>The best study I&#039;ve found so far suggests that anal sex doubles your risk of fecal incontinence, but there&#039;s caveats to that conclusion. Firstly, your risk of fetal incontinence is already very low. Secondly, the survey the study is based on didn&#039;t ask for frequency. Someone who got railed by a horse every day of the week for 20 years and someone who had anal sex once in college were coded the same. So it&#039;s a very rough indicator.<br><br>Protip: femoids plop out literal entire babbies and their vag handles it fine. The ass is made of similar stuff.

I&#039;d hate to see what you people are eating for dinner. Must be like two pieces of lettuce and a glass of water. <br><br>You know starving yourself isn&#039;t healthy. Fasting is one thing, but I think some of you take it to the extreme. Nobody said to go 2-3 days without eating, retards.",

Portion size and meal timing does not fucking matter at all as long as you&#039;re averaging a reasonable daily calorie intake. I might do 1-2 huge meals one day and snack from 8am until 8pm the next. It absolutely does not matter at all as far as gains are concerned as long as the nutrition is there.",

I wouldn&#039;t recommend lifting right away as you need to be a bit stronger with you back and core stability to decrease risks when lifting. <br>Squatting with weights can help with form and glute strength as its not just back muscles that help with scoliosis.<br>Do choose freeweights over machines most of the time as it allows for better stability if you decide to go that route.<br> <br>Really it wont go away but you can make your body strong enough that you don&#039;t even notice shit unless you do a lot of cardio and just need a good rest. <br>Foam rollers help with relaxing back muscles and you should also just search up stretches for the tight muscle areas to help with them. <br><br>Calisthenics I would say is the best option in the end that helps with this kind of issue as lifting can help but with larger risks than other people.

If you&#039;re trying to do that and lose weight just keep shoes, running surface, and impact all in mind so you don&#039;t hurt yourself. Definitely stretch your legs and ice your knees/ankles if you feel they&#039;re sore. Definitely also combine with basic calisthenic exercises afterward, like pushups and crunches/situps.<br><br>I am since out of the Army but I just wanted to tell you guys that you&#039;re all gonna make it.",

I had started lifting my first semester at 18. I came to the conclusion on my own that if I abstained from beating off, it would cause my testosterone to spike and give me bigger and better gains. I was obsessed with test at the time and testmaxxing because I had spent ages 17-18 going from 6’2” 288lbs to 170lbs lean and now wanted to get swole. I’d learned about test in my bio class and from there started with supplements and all that, whatever I could do naturally (not that I’m opposed to using gear, but I wasn’t ready at the time). So I came to this conclusion idek how but it made sense. I looked into it and it turned out “nofap” was a thing. Found all the benefits people report and it all appealed to me, because I was trying to not be a beta faggot virgin anymore like I was in HS. The benefits I got were: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eye contact</span><br>It came naturally, and I didn’t even realize for a while I was able to make it for once. I started making effort to make it and I’d unblinkingly stare at people like a maniac just to see how long I could do it. I was tired of getting checked out by girls around campus and looking down when we made eye contact. It was the first time I was getting checked out. I know it’s the height, because my face is only a 6-7/10. Now I would look until they looked away, sometimes smile at them in passing but that’s it. Often some would stare back equally as long like from across the library and I wish I had the balls to talk to them at the time.<br>Continued",

I got even worse with jacking off then I was before nofap. Before I beat it once a day sometimes twice at most and that was it. After a few months of just beating it once a week (7 day method is best imo), I started to get crazy urges. These 18-20 year olds on my campus in their yoga pants, and being able to find any not ugly or obese woman sexually attractive (urge to fuck and mate) while great was bad. I was still a pussy and couldn’t approach a girl or initiate conversation with one I didn’t know, because despite nofap and the benefits above, I never tried and was a bitch in this area. Got to the point where while studying in the morning in the library if a 6/10 walked by me I’d lose control. I started beating it 5x in an hour in the bathroom. I can remember this chubby Latina in yoga pants walking past me like 20 times and I couldn’t take it. Went and cranked my nuts out.<br><br><br>This spiraled into an out of control fap and porn addiction that I’ve had for 3 years now.

                "com": "Athletes sleep 10 hours a night because they need that recovery time. You apparently don&#039;t need that recovery time because you aren&#039;t using the energy. This is either A) because you&#039;re not active enough or B) because you simple don&#039;t need that amount of sleep. Not all athletes get 10 hours. Usually smart people and/or active people need more sleep. The brain uses a lot of energy throughout the day, so heavy recruitment in the bran leads to less overall energy. For example, I&#039;m both active and intelligent, so I sleep 20+ hours a day. Because I&#039;m so driven, my organs are taxed at their maximum capacity, which requires vast quantities of inert time. Even 20 or 30 minutes of problem solving will require many hours, even days of bed rest. But during those 20 or 30 minutes my brain is running like a furnace cranking out ideas and theorems, solving complex geomathematical equations at the drop of a hat. Ask me to drop bombs on that times table and I&#039;ll tell you 144 before you even ask. 144. See? You&#039;re lucky I&#039;m online right now and caught this thread during my break from resting. My work is done for the month of October. Time for bed.",

A power tower (pullup stand with things for leg lifts and dips) are about $150 which Id recommend. Ring dips are much harder but you can get to them by doing support hold until you can do it for like a minute. Then doing like 1/4 dips and working lower into the range of motion until you&#039;re parallel. It&#039;s pretty scary though and use a sweater or something.

Then you put or hand on an arm of your sofa or counter and do them assisted like that. Once you can do 15 of those you probably have the strength and balance to do one or two without support. So you do skill training on days between to get one or two up to a working set number. Skill training basically consists of setting like an interval timer to beep every minute 10 seconds then doing one rep on each side. Continue watching whatever show you&#039;re watching and wait for the next beep. This isn&#039;t really hyper trophy training so much as just getting much more familiar with the movment and form. You continue to do the assisted version doing your workouts until you can do enough of the unassisted version usually 5 or 6 to start using it in your workouts. You&#039;ll pretty much do the same thing when you&#039;re working on one arm pullups or one arm pushups. Try to give yourself at least one day a week of total rest though. So if you do full bodies Monday Wednesday Friday and skill training Tuesday Thursday Saturday have at least Sunday where you do nothing. It usually takes 2 weeks to a month of skill training to get from 1 rep to 5 or 6 so be patient.",

But you&#039;re practically a skeleton right now and you need to start fucking eating and lifting. If you literally just want a v taper and don&#039;t give a shit about anything else then just start doing pull ups.

Filling out your core will make your hips flare out less, if at all, filling out your back will give the taper, and filling out lateral delts will be the cherry on top. This works for basically all men. I had a body like yours at 120lbs, I lifted, and now I have a taper (my shoulder:waist isn&#039;t even that good but at least now I don&#039;t look like I have birthing hips). Get to work son.",

In a study of thirty-three hundred Italian men, researchers found that only height was correlated with larger penises, meaning the taller the man, the larger the penis. Height as a predictor of penis size was also supported in the results of the more than twenty-five thousand men profiled in the MSNBC/Elle.com survey: compared to men of average height significantly more guys who were shorter than five feet eight inches reported small penises and significantly more men who were taller than six feet reported large penises. And here’s another myth debunked: race is not a reliable indicator of penis size. Multiple studies have not found any consistent correlation between race, ethnicity and penis size.</span><br><br>We manlets just keep losing",

This is mostly coming the perspective as a tall person that sees guys habitually lie about their height, which is something everyone can see repeatedly over and over again. I am a legit 6&#039;4 and I haven&#039;t seen ANYONE taller than me since last Christmas. The amount of guys I see claiming 6&#039;2&quot; and I have a solid 4 inches on them at least is complete insanity. People lying about stuff that can&#039;t even be seen? Fuck its probably exaggerated an astronomical amount. <br><br>You also got to consider that girls just like guys are conditioned to enjoy sex, do you seriously unlikely that dick size is some sort of sexual arms race at this point? We have hundreds of thousands of years of evolution where most likely most dicks are gonna be suitable for most vaginas. I have a friend who is a legit 7&#039; in real life and he bottoms out every girl he has ever been with and its painful for them, I&#039;ve bottomed out a few girls with my 6&#039; dick and its just like what?

Nobody ever really asks me what I think in real life so you&#039;re already more of a friend to me than the people I work with everyday.

I&#039;m not getting sexually aroused by their ugly fat meat balloons or their Arby&#039;s roast beef sandwiches anymore either, I&#039;m starting to prefer women with smol tits and asses, traps, femboys, twinks, etc. I&#039;m scared on if I should come out or something cause I never thought I was gay and I try to normalize my thoughts and behaviors by thinking &quot;well I only like feminine men&quot; saying they&#039;re just &quot;upgraded chicks cause they have a little extra something to suck on.&quot; I mean I have absolutely no attraction to men more on the hairy/masculine side but I&#039;m afraid that I might develop a liking for them if this goes on.

Look at page 43, the description of leg press. &quot;After the leg curls and squats you should be sweating like crazy and have a great pump.&quot; Except there are no squats! I assume an earlier draft had squats programmed between leg curls and leg press, but he removed the squats without updating the rest of the text. There&#039;s a similar mistake in Baby Groot on workout 5. I see numerous typos that can make the routines fairly confusing for anyone paying attention, or some flat out nonsense mistakes like when he provides an example of how to do your 6-ways and gives a suggested weight of 105 lbs dumbbells lmao (Baby Groot, p47).",

These overly sexual feminist type women completely miss the mark about what makes someone &quot;sexy and attractive&quot;. They think that exposing more skin and being more flashy = being hot and causing lust.<br><br>See the real red pill is that sex appeal, as long as your BMI is below 25 and your is bodyfat below 20% for men or 30% for women, is all about the internal. A mix of personality, vibe, bodylanguage, energy and how you carry yourself. This concept is extremely deep, and I could easily write a whole book, but just to ilustrate compare my pic related to Hannah Montana <a href=\"#p57901428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57901428</a>.<br><br>Marilyn Monroe is practically covered from the neck down in clothing that is monotone and formal, has basic makeup, and is not doing any ridiculous posing, unlike Miley Cirus. HOWEVER, she carries herself with more dignity, has a more seductive look and facial expression, and her care for looking actually good does not go unoticed to the eye. What all of this comes down to is that any normal person would find Miley disgusting as all fuck, but Marilyn Monroe sexy and attractive as hell, because sexual attractiveness is not about being an oversexualized pig, it is about capturing the intrigue and imagination of the viewer.

In many ways, our society and our media are actually less sexual than they&#039;ve ever been. This is because we have eliminated all of the secondary associations and conflated sex with nothing more than the physical genitalia and their interactions. &quot;Gender&quot;, as per the liberal academic interpretation, has become something meaningless to be abolished. The only difference between men and women is what&#039;s between their legs and even that is becoming politically incorrect. Back when the concepts of masculine and feminine meant something, they were considered complementary aspects that were incomplete without the other. A woman needed a man and a man needed a woman because each fulfilled particular roles in society and in the family. Now that each have become interchangeable atomized consumers, the only thing either party needs the other for is physical gratification. I firmly believe that most films produced during the 1950s, where the men are men and the women are women contain more sexuality without showing any skin than films produced today with full frontal nudity. For all our progressivism and shameless flaunting of flesh, modern human beings are utterly starved for sexuality.",

Again, it is an overcompensation for lack of internal sex appeal.

It captivates the imagination, which is a hugh part of turning someone on. If you can just see everyone naked, there is nothing to get excited about.

Depending on where your sticking point is on a lift you might be able identify which specific muscle group might be lacking, so then you would want to switch to a variation where that muscle group gets worked more directly. Alternatively, you can just work through the sticking point with a lighter weight.<br><br>Conjugation periodization = Potentially more effective if you choose ideal variations, or less effective if you pick less than ideal variations. <br><br>Regular periodization = Simple, reliable results.

He&#039;s new to both terms so no need to overload him with every potential frequency he could alternate reps or lifts. He&#039;s also not advanced enough to need to worry about those yet and neither am I. Just occasionally alternating between 5 and 8-12 reps as needed is good enough at this stage. The differences in results between all of those frequency schemes is pretty negligible anyway, and changing reps vs lifts is a completely separate concept from how often you change the reps/lifts.",

They dont get in your way, but still have grippy rubber on the bottom and keep people from having to smell your feet. Also, high tops at least have something for ankle support if you ever want that.<br>I dont like how narrow they are, so I wear Reeboks crossfit shoes (got them for $40, so in the price range of Chucks), which have really big toes, and they make my feet bigger which gives me more ground contact. They have more of a sole (though it&#039;s a hard sole, not soft and squishy), so I&#039;m like 13 mm taller, but they feel flat.

Full base to tip constant sloppy suction (im just shy of 8 inches). I bust in about 2 minutes and she moans into my dick and swallows it all. I go back hers with her and fuck her for what seems like hours. She was a massive degenerate cockwhore so i ended up living out all of my fantasies in one night and some i didnt know existed. Her begging to swallow my cum each time. I wake up the next morning to her riding me reverse cowgirl, massaging my balls between her fingers and moaning my name over and over. Fucked her maybe 15-20 times per week for the remainder of the course.<br><br>At the end of the whole thing she just said it was nice to meet you and i never spoke to her again.<br><br>Shit was fucking cash bros best sex of my life.",

Then, I take ibuprofen for the headaches for the next few days and try to get plenty of water and sleep. Grogginess starts to recover after about a week, and you get back to a normal baseline, assuming you have more sleep, after that.",

My mental clarity feels god tier, like i could understand even the hardest math problems, I&#039;m on my way and i don&#039;t care who tries to stop me, I&#039;m gonna fucking be somebody.

Your ancestors were likely predisposed to violence and up until maybe the last 1000 years or our history being a violent psycho probably made your chances of thriving in your environment a lot higher. That much biological programming isn&#039;t going to disappear just because society has become less violent lately. Someday that violent side of you may be extremely useful and important, so just come to terms with it and take precautions to avoid losing control. Don&#039;t carry weapons, don&#039;t escalate confrontations, avoid people and situations that you know are going to make you angry, and if you do find yourself having urges to hurt people just remember it&#039;s completely normal to feel that way, it&#039;s only a problem if you act on those urges.",

                "com": "33. Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the “power process.” This is closely related to the need for power but is not quite the same thing. The power process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone.<br><br>34. Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one’s power.<br><br>35. Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization.<br><br>36. Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.<br><br>37, Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.",

The answer is that they will fuck those who possess relatively more resources, be it better food, more access to free time to train at a gym, those with better genetics. This fundamental evolution defining property of humanity excludes the existence of a socialist reality. Inequality is the defining aspect of evolutionary process and under no conditions is it feasible to achieve.

He would put off studying until two weeks vefore the exam, then cram. But instead of biting the bullet and learning from his mistakes, he flunked on the final day and didn&#039;t go. Rinse and repeat. I am halfway through my doctorate now and he hasn&#039;t even finished his bachelor&#039;s yet. He used to admit that he knows it is his fault and that he wants to better himself but after having met one of those sjw harpies and having been in a relation with her, he drank the entire sjw cool-aid. Nowadays, he just keeps saying that &quot;the system&quot; is to blame because it&#039;s racist against him. It&#039;s unbearable and I just stopped talking about politics with him because he&#039;s too far gone.<br><br>My ex was a case study of this phenomenon, too. Wanted to get into arts school, didn&#039;t put in enough work to get accepted to her favorite department and is now at some literally-who university for her &quot;&quot;&quot;art&quot;&quot;&quot;. The entire process made her go from that kind of feminism that still has some basis in reality (like not being a condescending dick just because someone&#039;s a woman) to the whole all-man-are-pigs spiel. I let her have it because c&#039;mon, live and let live, but eventually she broke up with me saying that she can&#039;t be with someone who doean&#039;t support her on this 100 %.<br><br>Those are only two examples but for me, that&#039;s a large enough sample size. Sjws, like all people in favor of extreme ideologies, definitely have some issues. Worst of all, by crying wolf over the smallest &quot;offenses&quot;, they&#039;re desensitizing people to actual injustices and give sensible left-leaning politics a bad name by sheer association.<br><br>I have a passionate hate for them but don&#039;t know what to do about it, so I just avoid them wherever possible, and refuse to use their neologisms.

Everyone has a secret skill that they can offer to the world. The problem is that you have to put work into it to see it all in bloom. Einstein for example would have never revolutionized modern physics with his 120+ IQ, had he not cultivated his skill in university training but stayed in that Swiss patent office. Zyzz would&#039;ve never become a sick cunt helping us make it, had he stayed at home instead of hitting the gym. Caring for your personal &quot;gift&quot; is hard work and can take years but in an era of instant gratification, less and less people see the point — as opposed to writing the n-th tweet about how The Man is keeping you down, which gives them the desired gratification in the form of upcummies within seconds or minutes. I remember that my generation (I was born in &#039;94) was the first one saying that &quot;we should take internet bullying seriously, guys!&quot;. And this perversion of the spirit by instant-everything and good-enough made us devolve into the forefront of the mob that will ruin some poor fuck&#039;s life just for posting a stupid joke in a tweet ten years ago. Imagine what crazy things people could&#039;ve done and how much potential has gone to waste in this sludge of &quot;I&#039;ll just do it tomorrow&quot; or &quot;It&#039;s good enough&quot;. It&#039;s fucking depressing.<br><br>And I mean sure, not everyone will have a lasting impression on the entire world, but that does not mean that you cannot be the best person you can be for *your own* world. Things like helping your friends move, lend them some tools so they can finish the project they always wanted to get done. Supporting them after a rough breakup, or sending them an actual analog card for their birthday instead of a post on a FB wall. Even just calling your parents every now and then to see if they&#039;re okay. Most people don&#039;t even do that and instead are content with just seeing their friends for the occasional beer.

I always hear some wrapper rustling from her room. She spends the entire day in her room watching shows. Oh and did i mention she is also fucking disgusting. Whenever she cooks something (desu it&#039;s mostly warming up frozen stuff) she makes a complete mess in the kitchen and doesn&#039;t clean up for days. After a few days I got myself my own cooker and just use that instead. Fat people are so fucking digusting. No self control. Only indulging in vices.

When he first got skinny, work took me out of the country for like 4 months, and when he came back I thought he had cancer or something - I&#039;d never seen him that thin and couldn&#039;t imagine that anything but cancer could have cut the weight that fast. <br>Turns out, by the way, that he had an umbilical hernia - found it once he was skinny. Doctors said he could have had it for decades - they never found it because it was small and hidden by a beer gut. <br>My mom said he looked &quot;unhealthy-skinny&quot; because she hadn&#039;t seen him that thin since &#039;Nam. I assured her that he&#039;s dead in the middle of healthy - got my parents a smart-scale to prove it. <br>A few months later, my mom asks me some basic nutrition questions, I show her how to count calories, I log her foods for her, give her daily tips via email. <br>I look at the smart-scale via interwebs, like I said, I set it all up and am kind of a coach, she&#039;s been dropping weight almost perfectly linearly - and at almost exactly 0.1 lbs per day. I haven&#039;t seen her in person since she started losing weight, but she&#039;s 18 lbs lighter. <br>Can&#039;t wait for thanksgiving - I&#039;ve never seen my parents this healthy. <br>Pic related - what I sent my mom on her birthday, blue is the healthy range. <br>My parents have always been work-a-holics, so I guess it&#039;s no surprise they would excel once they decided to go for it. <br>We&#039;re all gonna make it, bros. <br>And thank you FPH!",

I had to coach her pretty hard to eat more protein, she ate a truly insufficient amount. I also had to coach her pretty hard to eat more fat - she wouldn&#039;t eat avocados because they are so fat/calorie dense - had to teach her the different good vs bad fats and oils. <br>Her previous attempts at eating better would be just eating bland carbs like plain bagels and processed sweetened oatmeal. I had to explain to her why she needed to add some protein powder, and then I needed to explain to her and my dad that protein powder was basically just the old baby food formula (100% whey) - they had seen too many Nightly News stories of High School students fucking themselves up with retarded supplements.<br>Keep in mind, my parents are objectively very smart people - just very boomer.",

And even those more expensive places still have fat, carbs, salt, etc out the ass.)<br><br>I&#039;m with the other anons, we should tax fat people directly - at the very least, just like smokers pay more for insurance, fats should pay more - FAR more. <br><br>I&#039;m sure someone will note that fats die sooner, but they cost tremendously more while they die.

But Jello and gummi candies are also low fat, without the benefits of the low fat dairy (and they&#039;re still advertised with that). <br>And margarine is a fine substitute for butter (having neither is better), with 60% of the calories, after they stopped using partially hydrogenated vegitable oils (trans fats), assuming you dont have any more of it. But it&#039;s better to not add calories at all.<br>What protein bar can you describe as a candy bar? I get the cheap costco ones, which are about 190 calories with 20g of protein, while a Hershey bar is 220 with 4. And the protein bar takes longer to eat and is more substantial.<br>And the real healthy suggestions of the 80s are still true today. Eat lean meats, fruits, vegitables, dairy, and whole grains. Be careful with fatty meats. And be very conservative with added calories: butter, gravy, sugar, and syrup. You should weigh what you weighed in your late 20s for the rest of your life (that part is no longer true with the number of overweight/obese children).",

Like some italian anon’s grandmother a few threads ago who put a small amount in tomato sauce to balance the acidity (not like in <a href=\"#p57891264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;57891264</a> but like a tablespoon), my grandmother put a small amount in meatballs. But of course the jews, who once again did evil in the eyes of the Lord, figured out that they can find out the correct amount to add in basically anything. Both to make it taste better so people eat more, buy more, and partake in the spic-nig fried chicken-hospital cycle more. But also sugar fucks up the hormones that controls your hunger by messing up the insulin or whatever. There’s so much shit now with added sugar that never had sugar in it before, at least not these amounts. I really doubt they will tax it in countries where a shadowy group of merchants have political influence.<br>https://youtu.be/Yda8RtOcVFU",

Most people who do Keto stay obese, while those who actually have escaped obesity dont do keto. Ketones act largely the same as insulin in terms of weight management. Just eat fruits, vegitables, lean meats, and whole grains. Do not eat candy, fried foods, pantry junk, added sugars, added fats, and fatty meats. You will lose weight, because you will eat fewer calories. You will want to be sure to get some fatty fish or avacado, though, for the essential lipids.

In my state it would go straight to pensioners, just like our gas tax that was meant for roadwork.

If you lost all your weight through fasting there is a high chance you are dedicated to changing your whole lifestyle as well. Someone who fasts and does small 24hr fasts in one week and then goes back to eating after losing 3lbs are the ones you are talking about.",

Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re eating 1600 calories of pizza and soda every day, the weight will steadily melt off. The problem here is that the moment you get complacent and stop counting calories, you&#039;re going to rebound hard. Also, even if you&#039;re diligent, if you aren&#039;t pairing this with an escalating exercise regime, you&#039;re going to plateau at some point, and this will break you of any motivation you have to continue. You need an iron will to pull this off in the long-term, but if you had that, you probably wouldn&#039;t be such a fat fuck, right?<br><br>B) Drink water, avoid all sweets and snack foods, eat a filling breakfast, and then after that, only eat when you feel hunger pangs, while following general portion size guidelines.

Grab two packs of mayonnaise, put it on the hash browns, and slip them into the sandwiches. Squish it down and eat.<br>For lunch you’re gonna eat Chinese food. Now I don’t want you eating that crappy stuff. Get the stuff with MSG. None of that non-MSG bullshit. I don’t care what you eat but, sit down and eat for at least 45 minutes straight. You can’t let go of the fork. Eat until your eyes swell up and become slits and you start to look like the woman behind the counter.<br>For dinner, order an extra-large pizza with everything on it. Literally everything. If you don’t like sardines, don’t put ’em on. Anything else that you like you have to load it on there. After you pay the delivery guy, I want you to take the pie to your coffee table, open that fucker up, and grab a bottle of oil. It can be olive oil, canola oil, whatever. Anything but motor oil. Pour that shit over the pie until half of the bottle is gone. Soak the shit out of it.<br>Now before you lay into it, I want you to sit on your couch and stare at the fucker. Understand that that pizza right there is keeping you from your goals<br>Now you’re on the clock. After 20 minutes your brain is going to tell you you’re full. Don’t listen to that shit. Eat as much of the pizza as you can before 20 minutes. Double up pieces if you have to. Telling you now, you’re going to get three or four pieces in and you’re gonna want to quit. You fucking can’t. You have to sit on that couch until every piece is done.<br>And if you can’t finish it, don’t ever come back to me and tell me you can’t gain weight. ’Cause I’m gonna tell you that you don’t give a fuck about getting bigger and you don’t care how much you lift!",

        "op": "I FUCKING DID IT /FIT/: You fuckers said it was impossible but I regrew my hairline. It started off with a few thin, wispy strands near my temples and progressed to full on thicker, fuller hairline. Not only that, but I did it without taking any drugs or chemicals. I used to have horribly receding temples and grey hairs growing all over the place. My hair was dry and frail as fuck, and tons was falling out every day. Now I have thick, strong hair with zero noticeable grey hairs or hair loss. If you want to try a less invasive approach before hopping on tranny hormones, here's what I did, in order of importance: >diet Even if you buy fresh food from your local supermarket, chances are you're eating garbage. I started buying eggs, milk, fish, vegetables, and meat from local farmers markets or specialized stores.  >dermarolling Did this every night before bed unless my scalp was so red and sore I couldn't. If you're doing this shit and your eyes aren't watering from the pain, you're doing it wrong.  >proper shampoo/conditioner Started using anti-hair loss shampoo / conditioner. Stopped washing my hair daily and gave it 2-3 days to rest between washes. Stopped using hot water on my hair ever. Once a week I used a keto shampoo to remove DHT buildup on the follicles.  >henna hair dye Mainly used this to mask the grey hairs but after using it for the first time I noticed my hair felt a lot stronger and thicker. Leave that shit on for like 35 minutes then wash it out with cool water.  >supplements Zinc, Biotin, Vitamin D. In theory shouldn't be necessary with a good diet but can't hurt. >castor oil Not sure if this does anything but I used it sometimes after dermarolling. Could have benefits and doesn't cause any harm so no reason not to try it. That's about it. It's a long process and it took about a month before seeing any results but it worked for me. Don't be retarded and try this shit first before you hop on fin and ruin your dick.",
